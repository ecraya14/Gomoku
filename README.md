# Gomoku
Java program to play the game Gomoku, or five-in-a-row, on an 8 Ã— 8 board against a computer player (MinMaxPlayer) based on Minimax search algorithm using alpha-beta pruning. 

Download all files and put them in the same directory. Run the GomokuReferee.class to start playing. This includes a graphical interface which allows you to play against the computer player or watch games between computer players (you can add computer players based on other algorithms yourself). It automatically finds any player classes which are in the same directory.

The game is played as follows: two players (white and black) take turns at placing a stone of his/her colour on an unoccupied square on the board (white moves first). The first player to complete a continuous horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of 5 or more stones of his/her colour is the winner.
